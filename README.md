Hi, I'm Kirk Woodill ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm from and currently living in Canterbury, New Zealand.

Iâ€™ve had an interest ðŸ‘€ in web development since '03, when I built my first website just as I was starting high school. After school, I pursued my dream of becoming a pilot :airplane:, obtaining my commercial licence in '12. Since the COVID pandemic, I've started pursuing a career in web development by freshing up on skills & languages I've learn in the past, as well as spending time learning new ones. My goal is to initially secure a job as a front-end developer, and as my knowledge and experience grows, transistion to becoming a full-stack developer.  :computer:
