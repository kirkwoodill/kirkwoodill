Hi, I'm Kirk Woodill 👋 

I'm from and currently living in Canterbury, New Zealand. :new_zealand:	

I’ve had an interest 👀 in web development since '03, when I built my first website just as I was starting high school.
After school, I pursued my dream of becoming a pilot :small_airplane:, obtaining my commercial licence in '12. Since the COVID pandemic, I've looked to retrain as a full-stack developer.
